# Documentation and general communication space

Being sick and tired of simple UI components being tied into big web frameworks, we started
the minui initiative to create a UI component library that focusses on a few very specific requirements:

- zero dependencies (no Angular, Polymer, etc)
- few, or ideally no indirect dependencies (no Less, Babel, etc)

In this repository, we use the issue tracker to share concepts.
